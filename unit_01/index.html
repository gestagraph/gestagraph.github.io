		<h2>Why</h2>
		<p>â€œWe shed as we pick up, like travellers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very short. We die on the march. But there is nothing outside the march so nothing can be lost to it.  --Tom Stoppard </p>

	<h2>Examples</h2>
		<li>
			<ul>Sherrie has a collection of her mother and grandmother's handwritten recipies.  Her children and grandchildren are low-key
				fighting over who will take over these precious family heirlooms.  Sherrie wants a way to share them, paired with photos
				and the family history.  She decidess she wants to share them electronically by creating a password-protected blog that only
				the family can access, but she doesn't know how.  GestaGraph helps Sherrie develop a plan, and decide on a platform; provides
				technical support as Sherrie becomes self-sufficient with her blog; and when Sherrie decides she also wants to turn this Project
				into a hard-copy book, GestaGraph coaches Sherrie through the process of selecting a print-on-demand provider and preparing
					project for printing.</ul>
			<ul>As a young man, Daniel joined the French Resistence to the Nazi invasion.  Daniel has stories he's never been able to fully tell.
			Daniel wants his personal role in history written down, just to know that his view on truth of that time won't be lost to history.
		Daniel isn't up to doing the typing himself: he wants GestaGraph to sit with him, ask questions, and record the answers.</ul>
